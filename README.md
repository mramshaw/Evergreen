# Evergreen

Getting up to speed with [Cypress](http://cypress.io)

A cypress is an ___evergreen___. If your tests stay ever green, you're golden.

## Motivation

Now that web applications are increasingly reactive, front-end tests are important.

That has always been as area where good tools were lacking, so I was interested in
getting a good look at Cypress.

And of course the best way to learn something is to play with it.
